## A series of extra credit lessons developed for Harvey Mudd's intro to computer science course



As part of my research in summer 2017, I developed [R](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wgt1Yf4y-DA4CryWYL5PMleZrE5o_b6NtJFb78AYei8/edit?usp=sharing), [Arduino](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zup-6xh8cvfS0YB8nJjAIyCkepn5gcCbVOm5CMy8pIM/edit?usp=sharing), [Processing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zup-6xh8cvfS0YB8nJjAIyCkepn5gcCbVOm5CMy8pIM/edit?usp=sharing), [Arduino meets Processing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zup-6xh8cvfS0YB8nJjAIyCkepn5gcCbVOm5CMy8pIM/edit?usp=sharing), and [Java](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z40qS0amt2cR8tA7wnnLRahS296WobOdmRlCg3NpEYY/edit?usp=sharing) lessons. The code for these lessons lives in this repository and the instructions are linked above from Google Docs.
